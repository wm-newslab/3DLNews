## 1. About 
We present [3DLNews](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04716), a novel dataset with local news articles from the United States spanning the period from 1996 to 2024. It contains almost 1 million URLs (and HTML text) from over 14,000 local newspapers, TV, and radio stations across all 50 states, and provides a broad snapshot of the US local news landscape. The dataset was collected by scraping Google and Twitter search results. We employed a multi-step filtering process to remove non-news article links and enriched the dataset with metadata such as the names and geo-coordinates of the source news media organizations, article publication dates, etc. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of 3DLNews by outlining four applications.

## 3. 3DLNews Dataset

### 3.1 Local news media dataset
We used an extended version of the Local Memory Project's (LMP) US local news dataset to get the local news media outlets. LMP's dataset consists of the websites of 5,993 local newspapers, 2,539 TV stations, and 1,061 radio stations, primarily extracted from [thepaperboy.com](thepaperboy.com) in 2016. We extended it by crawling and scraping [thepaperboy.com](thepaperboy.com) (again), [web.archive.org/web/20221203031956/http://www.usnpl.com/](web.archive.org/web/20221203031956/http://www.usnpl.com/), [50states.com](50states.com), and [einpresswire.com/world-media-directory/3/united-states](einpresswire.com/world-media-directory/3/united-states). Table 1 outline the number of local news media outlets that we have used to extract local news articles. The `broadcast` type refers to either TV or radio stations, because we could not accurately distinguish them during scraping.

The  improved local news media outlets dataset can be downloaded from here: [usa_2016_2024_pu5e.json.gz](https://github.com/wm-newslab/3DLNews/blob/main/resources/usa_2016_2024_pu5e.json.gz)

**Table 1:  US local news media dataset.**

| Media Type | Number of websites |
|------------|---------------------|
| Newspapers | 9,441               |
| Radio      | 2,449               |
| Broadcast  | 1,310               |
| TV         | 886                 |
| **Total**  | **14,086**          |

We issued Google and Twitter search queries to their respective search engines and scraped their links. For Google, we created queries from 1996 – 2024, for Twitter, 2006 – 2024. Table 2
presents the number of links scraped from Google and Twitter for each media type.

**Table 2: 3DLNews-raw: Number of URLs (non-news URLs included)**

| **Total**   | **994,415** | **296,541**   | **1,290,956** |

### 3.2 Data Filtering

We removed non-news article links by applying a filtering process outlined below. 

- **Step 1:** Dereferenced all URLs to resolve redirects and retrieved final URLs that returned HTTP 200 response codes.

- **Step 2:** Removed links with domains not present in our local news media dataset.

- **Step 3:** Third, we converted all URLs to lowercase, discarded trailing slashes, and removed duplicate URLs.

- **Step 4:** As URLs with a path depth of zero, typically representing homepages, URLs with a path depth of zero were removed.

- **Step 5:** As we observed that news URLs occurred at lower path depths (e.g.,< 3), we kept such news article URLs only if they included popular word-boundary separators such as ‘-’, ‘_’, or ‘.’ We kept all URLs with path depth ≥ 3. 


Table 3 presents the number of news articles after filtering.

**Table 3: 3DLNews: Number of news article URLs (non-news URLs excluded)**

| Type        | Google    | Twitter   | Total     |

| Broadcast   | 110,494   | 7,783     | 130,144   |
| **Total**   | **728,676** | **95,899** | **824,575** |

### 3.3 Data Enrichment

The Google directory contains JSONL files with news article URLs extracted through Google scraping. Each JSONL file represents a collection of URLs and their associated metadata gathered from automated searches on Google.

The Twitter directory holds JSONL files with news article URLs obtained via Twitter scraping. Each JSONL file includes URLs and metadata collected from tweets, providing a diverse set of news articles shared on the Twitter platform.

Within both the Twitter and Google directories, there are three main directories for each news media type. Inside each media type folder, the following main directories are included:

- **state:** Contains scraped data for each state for each year.
- **preprocessed_data:** Contains directories for each state. Within each state directory, there are jsonl.gz files for each year, which include data objects for each URL with metadata.
- **HTML:** Contains the HTML content for each article for each state for each year, named with the hash value of each article URL.
